Early in my career, my manager and colleagues were engaged in a jovial discussion of a candidate they had just interviewed. The most remarkable point was that this fellow had stated, in a deadpan manner, that his goal was to be the best programmer in the world. The humour wasn't so much this goal, which is both ambitious and admirable, but how one would claim such a title, who would they need to dethrown, and what would it take to get to the top? The field of professional software development isn't like competitive tennis or chess. There is no distinction of a Master or Grandmaster Software Developer. As far as we were aware, our field lacked any systematic merit and ranking system.

[Paul Wheaton](https://richsoil.com/paul-wheaton.jsp) came up with the [Wheaton Eco Scale](https://permies.com/t/3069/Wheaton-Eco-Scale) as a means of relatively ranking how people think, behave, and are perceived by others.

This is my attempt at applying this analogy to the domain of software development. With Paul's permission, I give you the **Serratore Dev Scale**. 

* serratore dev level 0:  about 10 million people
* serratore dev level 1:  about 10 million people
* serratore dev level 2:  about a million people
* serratore dev level 3:  about 100,000 people
* serratore dev level 4:  about 10,000 people
* serratore dev level 5:  about a thousand people
* serratore dev level 6:  about 100 people
* serratore dev level 7:  about 10 people
* serratore dev level 8:  1 person

* level 0: According to [this guy's findings](http://coding-and-more.blogspot.com/2011/06/its-official-developers-get-better-with.html), the world's population of developers doubles roughly every five years. Therefore, one half of the world's population of developers at any given time has less than 5 years of experience. Many of them lack any formal training in the field. Now I'm not saying experience is everything or that this metric qualifies this entire group as zeroes, far from it. Let's assume approximately one half of this crowd are over achievers and have moved up the scale. That leaves about 5 million developers who are still green and finding their way. Where do the other 5 million come from? Like I said, experience isn't everything. Let's add about half of the rest of the crowd, the under achievers who have put in the time, but nothing more. To them, coding is just a way to pays the bills. Their lack of knowledge and discipline presents risks to the security, performance and maintainability of complex or critical systems that requires oversight to mitigate.

* level 1: This consists of most of the other half. They have a sense of code smell and can recognize good code from bad when they see it. Given appropriate frameworks, templates and examples to work from, they can produce results reliably, but lack the knowledge and insight into what practices result in good code and would struggle to create consistently quality material on their own.

* level 2: In addition to level 1, you are a clean coder.

* level 3: In addition to level 2, you practice and advocate for best practices such as test driven development, automation, extreme programming, and solution driven development. You contribute to open source software. You continuously update your technical skills to keep abreast of the evolving landscape. People look to you as a technical leader.

* level 4: In addition to level 3, you are principled and have specialized hard and soft skills that set you apart from the crowd. You look at the big picture and understand how you and your team contribute to the overall business. You lead by example and advocate for advanced or alternative practices such as domain driven design and clean architecture.

* level 5: In addition to level 4, you are an outlier. You seek continuous learning and improvement. You are an active and public contributor that maintains a brand and seeks to educate and influence others through social media, training courses, speaking engagements and publications. You contribute to philothropic endeavors such as pro bono work. You are an entrepreneur and work towards the freedom to contribute on your own terms through your skills and financial slack.

* level 6: In addition to level 5, you've made significant advancements in the field and have laid foundations for others to move up the scale.

* level 7: In addition to level 6, you demonstrably use your knowledge and influence to actively move the masses up the scale.

* level 8: Transcends the field and serves as an aspirational example of what is possible.

The specific metrics and credentials of each level is largely subjective. You may certainly have your own views of each level. Thus, I have resisted the temptation of mentioning individual candidates for the highest levels. The point is to illustrate the magnitude of difference between each level of the scale and what it takes to distinguish oneself from the crowd in order to "level up". The field of software developers is a large one, and the opinion of who best qualifies and represents the top three levels is largely subjective, based on one's personal views. Personally, I have a difficult time filtering a list of level 7 candidates. As for level 8, it would take some reflection and research of each of these individuals to make an informed decision on who, in my opinion, is the most deserving of that position.

As a matter of personal development, which is really the point of this scale, ask yourself the following questions:
1. Where do you see yourself? 
2. Do you aspire to move up?
3. What goals can you define for yourself to level up?

P.S. What became of that interview candidate all those years ago? We didn't hire him. 
Whether he didn't meet our expectations or he took another offer I don't recall. I didn't participate in the interview to have the opportunity to meet him first-hand, so it may be that he was still early on his journey to his end goal. Looking back, however, I wonder if he may have been so far up the scale that our perception of him and his goals seemed crazy and unrelatable to us. What a missed opportunity that would be, eh?
