I am an expert in software development, design, and architecture, with a few other skills and interests thrown into the mix. I work for [AudienceView](https://audienceview.com/), the most comprehensive ticketing and e-commerce platform in the world, working with experts in the entertainment, theatre, and athletics industries to transform and translate business processes into value-added product features and platform enhancements.

I have previously served as Product Architect, Business Analyst, technical lead, and developer of multi-tiered software systems spanning oil and gas, petro-chemical, supply chain management, and airport and airline industries.
