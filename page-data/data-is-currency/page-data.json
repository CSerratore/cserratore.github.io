This is monetary expansion.</li>\n<li>Scale this up to multiple banks, customers and loans, and you have a currency-backed economy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Data is the currency of the digital economy.</p>\n<p>Yet, most software organizations still treat data a little more than a byproduct of behavioral features.</p>\n<p>At best, data may be disposed of to a centralized data lake or warehouses—a metaphorical landfill—for a centralized business intelligence team to pick through.</p>\n<p>What if we truly started treating the data of our systems as the fundamental currency of our systems?</p>\n<p>How can we leverage data as currency to achieve the objective of realizing the value potential of a software system?</p>\n<p>As usual, seek analogies and patterns in existing systems. In this case, the traditional currency-backed economic system.</p>\n<p>What does this system demonstrate? The potential of <strong>monetary expansion</strong>.</p>\n<p>What is the key driver of monetary expansion?</p>\n<p>The <strong>free exchange of money</strong>.</p>\n<p>Free as in based on a system and policies that facilitate a relatively unobstructed exchange of money (currency) between individuals and organizations.</p>\n<p>So they may apply leverage and add value to the overall system.</p>\n<p>Software systems have traditionally lacked an underlying system and policies to facilitate such a free flow of data.</p>\n<p>Until now.

It's a rich topic.</p>\n<p>For now, a summary of the principles are sufficient to see how it aligns with and supports the objective of monetary expansion, based on data as the currency.</p>\n<p>The four core principles of data mesh are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture\n<ul>\n<li>the domain and system of origin is responsible for the data, it's quality, and availability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>data as a product (currency)\n<ul>\n<li>data is the currency. Product owners should give it equal consideration as a product or feature as behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>self-serve data infrastructure as a platform\n<ul>\n<li>Just as you can easily access your money online, remotely via bank cards, or at ATMs, other software systems and teams should have convenient self service access to your data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>federated computational governance.\n<ul>\n<li>Interoperability through global standards, dynamic topology, discoverability, and automation in a distributed rather than centralized manner.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Payback</h2>\n<p>An organization that embraces data mesh principles will have a distinctive and unfair advantage over their competitors that do not.</p>\n<p>Silos that previously impeded integration and collaboration between product teams fall.</p>\n<p>Instead of highly coupled integrations that require high-bandwidth communication and coordination between teams, integration becomes much more passive and autonomous.</p>\n<p>Downstream consumers can simply opt-in and tap into existing data streams and decide if and how they can leverage it to add value.</p>\n<p>A free flow and exchange of data removes the barriers of discovery and awareness of what is available and what is possible.</p>\n<p>Value potential that was previously buried under product teams' mattresses is now unlocked and can be realized by facilitating experimentation and innovation.</p>\n<h2>Risks and Mitigation</h2>\n<p>Of course, nothing is free. Free markets thrive because they rely on a strong foundation of principles and policies. Consideration for all four data mesh principles are important to the success of a data mesh strategy.</p>\n<p>Without domain-oriented data ownership and architecture, you risk the inefficient dependency and bureaucracy of a centralized business intelligence team. You also lose accountability for data quality and change management, impacting the quality and resilience of downstream consumers, and the value they are able to deliver.</p>\n<p>Without a commitment to data as a product, data will continue to be treated as an afterthought and the potential of data mesh will be unrealized and the initiative runs the risk of withering on the vine.</p>\n<p>Without a focus on a self-serve data infrastructure as a platform, frictions for sharing and consuming data may be sufficient to disincentive and de-prioritize such efforts. Again, the initiative may never gain traction.</p>\n<p>Finally, without federated computation governance, an abundance of inefficiencies, friction, and quality issues may cause the entire data mesh initiative to collapse under its own weight. Data mesh requires some effort, commitment, and discipline. The payoff is returned in multiples.</p>\n<h2>Related Practices, Patterns, and Technologies</h2>\n<p>The data mesh principles do not subscribe any specific practices, patterns or technologies. However, many align very well, such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Event driven architecture and business process choreography</li>\n<li>Event streaming</li>\n<li>Domain Driven Design</li>\n<li>Apache Kafka</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wrap it up and leave with value. Recap what they learned.</p>\n<p>The next time you are working on a value proposition for a product or feature, give equal consideration to the data as well as the behavior.</p>\n<p>Remember, it's the data that results from a software system's behavior that solves a problem, and this data has the potential to enable other downstream systems to solve their problems as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you love something, let it go. If it returns, it's yours; if it doesn't it wasn't.\n—Unknown</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Set your data free. It it has value, that value will return to you in multiples.\n—Cory Serratore</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you like this kind of thing, consider following me on Twitter, where I provide bit-sized tidbits of my thoughts and experiences on topics I am passionate (or just curious) about, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the digital creator economy</li>\n<li>building scalable software systems, teams, and organizations</li>\n<li>life lessons and inspirations from The Beatles</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 28, 2023","slug":"data-is-currency","title":"Data Is The Currency Of The Digital Economy"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"22bd758f-eda4-592c-8962-1244b3b70f19","frontmatter__slug":"data-is-currency","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"data-is-currency"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
