It is a multiverse of infinite possibilities.</p>\n<p>But we are finite beings. We cannot do all things. We cannot be all things for everyone.</p>\n<p>We have limited time. We have limited resources.</p>\n<p>We have to make choices - often difficult ones. Otherwise, it's far too easy for us to fall into traps that will suck us into the infinite void.</p>\n<p>These traps are mischievous and devious.</p>\n<p>They distract us and deprive us of our progress, our purpose, and our goals. They temp us with false promises. They lure us with illusions of progress.</p>\n<p>Only too late do we discover we've been caught in their many webs.</p>\n<p>But if you know what to look for, they are easy to identify. Here are a few that I'm sure will ring familiar to you.</p>\n<h2>The Generalist</h2>\n<p>The generalist trap lures those who suffer from shiny object syndrome. There's always something masquerading as the silver bullet to your problems.</p>\n<p>It may be a new industry trend. It may a big elephant prospect you are hunting.</p>\n<p>There are no silver bullets, of course.</p>\n<p>Trends are, by definition, short-term.</p>\n<p>Catching that big elephant comes with a price. Elephants are big, hungry and demanding animals. You'll need to catch another one to cover the ongoing expenses of the first.</p>\n<p>Before long, you've spread yourself a mile wide and an inch deep. The phrase \"a Jack of all trades and a master of none\" rings true for companies that fall into this trap.</p>\n<p>Without a distinguishing value, your only option is to compete on price. It's a race to the bottom from here.</p>\n<h2>The Feature Treadmill</h2>\n<p>The feature treadmill is a phenomenon in which competing companies engage in a battle of feature escalation.</p>\n<p>The product roadmap is a stream of feature ideas on the belief that each one provides a competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>A Scrum-based development approach consists of an endless march of feature-driven sprints.</p>\n<p>Products become complex and unwieldy. Development is expensive to maintain. Usability suffers as a result of cognitive overload and a surplus of options for end users to navigate.</p>\n<p>Like the generalist trap, knowledge and resources are diluted. The value proposition of the company becomes murky.</p>\n<h2>The Agency</h2>\n<p>Are you running an agency that bills clients on a time for money basis?</p>\n<p>If not, why on earth would you model your business like one?</p>\n<p>The agency trap takes the generalist and feature treadmill traps to an extreme.</p>\n<p>The agency trap outsources the product roadmap to clients to define. The result is a grab bag of disjoint product functionality - the union of all client requirements. There is no cohesive model of the domain. There is no prescriptive support of common business processes.</p>\n<p>This is an agency model in denial. Only when zooming out does one realize how unsustainable it is to run a product this way. New client acquisitions fund the ongoing maintenance of the previous client solutions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What you lose in every deal, you make up in volume.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>A (Not So) Secret Weapon</h2>\n<p>If only there was a way to narrow the solution space to something manageable. Something finite. Something that can help avoid falling into solution traps.</p>\n<p>You need a weapon.</p>\n<p>What kind of weapon? The Thanos killing kind?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Star-Lord: Don't you think we all should have a weapon like that?\nThor: No, you simply lack the strength to wield it, your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into madness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We live in the real world, not the multiverse of fantasy comics. We're not dealing with a Thano-level of existential threat and we don't need that kind of weapon.</p>\n<p>But we do have powerful weapons to deal with the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>And we have the knowledge and strength to wield them.</p>\n<p>The weapons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A strategic business problem</li>\n<li>Decomposition by subdomains</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The knowledge and strength to wield them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insight into the problem and solution spaces of your Domain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Domain</h2>\n<p>The Domain refers to the specific industry or field in which your business operates. It represents the area of expertise, focus, or specialization of your business.</p>\n<p>It helps to look at a domain as two spaces: the Problem Space and the Solution Space.</p>\n<h3>The Problem Space</h3>\n<p>The Problem Space is the strategic business problem. It is your vision and a set of goals you define to make it your reality.</p>\n<p>Some goals are small and achievable. Others are large in scope and filled with unknowns and risks. You break these down into incremental objectives that move you towards the goal.</p>\n<p>Rather than plot all these goals in advance, I recommend you focus on them one at a time.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This will avoid analysis paralysis. Getting started on the first objective will reveal a deeper understanding of the problem space.  It will also inform the next objective in the path towards your goal.</li>\n<li>You'll waste less effort trying to solve problems that you don't yet understand or may never come to pass.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each objective will reveal problems to solve. These are your stories and use cases. Solving them is how you provide value to you customers.</p>\n<h3>The Solution Space</h3>\n<p>The Solution Space is a model of the problem space.</p>\n<p>A model is a representation of a domain problem. It takes the form of business processes at the macro level and use cases as the micro level of design.</p>\n<p>Technology enables innovation in the forms of business process automation and transformation. These more effective and efficient forms of a business process yield a higher value result.</p>\n<p>For example, the printing press transformed the business processes of information distribution. This replaced handwritten duplication with far more efficient (and affordable) printed books. This had a profound effect on society by lowering the barriers of literacy and education.</p>\n<p>The computer and internet ages have enabled further business process automation and transformation. The effects on society... game changing.</p>\n<p>But here's the rub:</p>\n<p><em>there is no such thing as a perfect, or even a correct, model</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All models are wrong but some are useful.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>George Box</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The solution space is infinite. Every model is subjective. Every model is the result of decisions, trade-offs, and forces influenced by the knowledge and skills of its creators.</p>\n<p>Here's another important fact to be aware of:</p>\n<p><em>not all domains are equal</em>. Some are larger in scope and more complex than others.</p>\n<p>Many domains are sufficiently large and complex that they defy the capacity of any individual or team to comprehend and model. We call this the <em>cognitive load</em> of a domain.</p>\n<p>Figuratively speaking, your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into madness.</p>\n<p>But now you have awareness - the first level of weapons to tackle the problem space.</p>\n<p>In future installments, I'll share additional weapons and the knowledge and strength to wield them.</p>\n<p>I'll share practices and patterns that will give you an edge when dealing with even the largest and most complex problem and solution domain.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, thank you for reading.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 26, 2023","slug":"the-solution-space-and-the-multiverse-of-madness","title":"The Solution Space And The Multiverse Of Madness"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"759856e6-0e2b-5d4e-aee9-95ca2759fbdd","frontmatter__slug":"the-solution-space-and-the-multiverse-of-madness","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"the-solution-space-and-the-multiverse-of-madness"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4080856488"],"slicesMap":{}}
