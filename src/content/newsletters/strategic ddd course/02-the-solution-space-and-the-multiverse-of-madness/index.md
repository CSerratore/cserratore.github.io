# The Solution Space and the Multiverse of Madness

The Solution Space is infinite. It is a multiverse of infinite possibilities.

But we are finite beings. We cannot do all things. We cannot be all things for everyone. 

We have limited time. We have limited resources.

We have to make choices - often difficult ones.

Otherwise, it's far too easy for us to fall into traps that will suck us into the infinite void and distract us and deprive us of our progress, our purpose, and our goals.

These traps are mischievous and devious. They temp us with false promises. They lure us with illusions of progress. Only too late do we discover we've been caught in their many webs. But if you know what to look for, they are easy to identify. Here are a few that I'm sure will ring familiar to you.

## The Generalist

The generalist trap is a temping lure for anyone predisposed to shiny object syndrome. There's always a new trend or big elephant prospect masquerading as the silver bullet you've been looking for.

There are no silver bullets, of course. Trends are, by definition, short-term. Catching that big elephant typically comes with a price. Elephants are big, hungry and demanding animals. You'll need to catch another one to cover the ongoing expenses you've now assumed.

Before long, you've spread yourself a mile wide and an inch deep. The phrase "a Jack of all trades and a master of none" rings true for companies that fall into this trap.

Without any specialized and distinguishing value, your only option is to compete on price and it's a race to the bottom.

## The Feature Treadmill

The feature treadmill trap is a phenomenon in which companies find themselves in a battle to one-up their competitors by adding more features to their product and service offerings.

Product roadmaps are nothing more than a stream of feature ideas, based on the believe that each one will give them a competitive edge. The product development lifecycle will typically embrace a scrum-based approach consistent of an endless march of feature-driven sprints.

Products eventually become complex and unwieldy. Development is increasingly expensive to maintain. Usability suffers as a result of cognitive overload and a surplus of options for end users to navigate.

Similar to the generalist trap, knowledge and resources are diluted. The value proposition of the company becomes murky.

## The Agency

Unless you are running an agency that bills clients on a time for money basis.
The agency trap takes the generalist and feature treadmill traps to an extreme.

A misinterpretation of the agile mindset, in which the customer or their representative is a regular part of the team, the agency trap effectively outsources the product roadmap, if not the entire business model, to clients to define.

This trap typically results in a grab bag of product functionality resembling a union of all client requirements and use cases, at best, and a collection of bespoke projects rather than products, at worst.

This is an agency model in denial. Only when looking at the big picture, long term, does one realize
that this is effectively a ponzi scheme, in which new client acquisitions fund the ongoing maintenance of the previous client solutions.

## A (Not So) Secret Weapon

If only there was a way to narrow the solution space to something manageable. Something finite. Something that can help avoid falling into solution traps.

You need a weapon.

What kind of weapon? The Thanos killing kind?

> Star-Lord: Don't you think we all should have a weapon like that?
> Thor: No, you simply lack the strength to wield it,Â your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into madness.

We live in the real world, not the multiverse of fantasy comics. We're not dealing with a Thano-level of existential threat and we don't need that kind of weapon.

But we do have powerful weapons to deal with the problem at hand.

And we have the knowledge and strength to wield them.

The weapons:

- A strategic business problem to be solved
- Decomposition by subdomains

The knowledge and strength to wield them:

- Insight into the problem and solution spaces of your Domain.

## The Domain

The Domain refers to the specific industry or field in which your business operates. It represents the area of expertise, focus, or specialization of your business.

It helps to look at a domain as two spaces: the Problem Space and the Solution Space.

### The Problem Space

The Problem Space is the business problem to be solved. It is your vision and a set of goals you define to make it your reality.

Some goals are small and easily achievable. Others are large in scope and filled with unknowns and risks. So you break these down into individual and incremental objectives that move you towards the goal.

Rather than plot out all of these goals in advance, I recommend you focus on them one at a time for two reasons:

1. This will avoid analysis paralysis. Getting started on the first objective will reveal a deeper understanding of the problem space and will inform the next objective in the path towards your goal.
2. You'll waste less effort trying to predict and solve problems that you don't fully understand or that may never come to pass.

Each objective will reveal problems to solve. These are your stories. Solving them is how you provide value to you customers.

### The Solution Space

The Solution Space is a model of the problem space.

A model is a representation of a domain problem in the form of business processes at the macro level and use cases as the micro level of design.

Technology and innovation enables automation and transformation of a business process into a more effective and efficient form to yield a higher value result.

For example, the printing press transformed the business processes of information distribution. Inefficient (and expensive and exclusive) handwritten duplication was replaced with far more efficient (and affordable) printed books. The had a profound effect on society by lowering the barriers of literacy and education.

The computer and internet ages have enabled further business process automation and transformation that have also had profound effects on society.

Here's the rub: _there is no such thing as a perfect, or even a correct, model_.

> All models are wrong but some are useful
>  
> - George Box

The solution space is infinite. Every model is subjective. Every model is the result of decisions, trade-offs, and forces that are individually influenced by the knowledge and skills of its creators.

Here's another important fact to be aware of: _not all domains are equal_. Some are larger in scope and more complex than others.

Many domains are sufficiently large and complex that they defy the capacity - the _cognitive load_ - of any individual or team to fully comprehend and model.

Figuratively speaking, your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into madness.

Now you have awareness. In the next installment, I'll share additional weapons and the knowledge and strength to wield them, in the form of practices and patterns to take on your problem and solution domain.

Thank you for reading.
